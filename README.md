# CJ's Hoffmann V60 Ratio & Timing Guide 

Check out the shiny app here: https://cjarayata.shinyapps.io/coffee-shiny/

This is a Shiny app to help me with making pour-over coffee in the morning. I have a lot of Post-Its with brew charts for varying volumes, pages in a notebook that tell me all the past ratios I've tried and which one tastes best for which coffee, etc. A lot of this is based on James Hoffmann's YouTube videos, but tweaked by me based on my experience thus far.

Over time, I've been adding improvements to this shiny and would like to include more brewing methods and more coffees as I explore them. I invite you to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/cjarayata/coffee-shiny/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">previously-closed issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cjarayata/coffee-shiny/issues">open issues</a> to see what I've been doing and thinking about.

# coffee-shiny
A Shiny app to help me with making coffee in the morning. I have a lot of Post-Its with brew charts, pages in a notebook that tell me what ratio tastes best for which coffee, etc. A lot of this is based on "The Ultimate V60 Technique" by James Hoffman, but tweaked by me based on my experience thus far.
